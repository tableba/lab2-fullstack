One of the main challenges was serving the React frontend properly from the Express backend, especially in a module-based project setup. 
There was a lack of clear documentation on how to handle routing to serve the React app correctly when using ES modules in Express. 
After some research and experimentation, the solution was to add a catch-all route with app.get('/*', (req, res) => { res.sendFile(path_to_react_build/index.html) }).

Another challenge was getting used to React's syntax. 
JSX and the use of hooks like useState and useEffect seemed odd and different compared to standard JavaScript at first glance, but after some practice, it started to make sense.

I reused the database connection setup from Lab 1, which made the MongoDB integration straightforward.

If I were to redo the project, I would invest a bit more time upfront learning Reactâ€™s basic concepts to speed up the initial setup.

No additional libraries or frameworks were used beyond the ones required.
